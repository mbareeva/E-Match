# E-Match

This project is aimed at the finding out whether Elasticsearch alone can create recommendations for the target user. The problem of recommendations is researched through a search lense to find out whether users with relevant content can be found using only Elasticsearch functions and techniques.
The dataset is based on the public user profile data from the social network Instagram. The research also gives an overview on how to work with Instagram Graph API for requesting profile and media data (only public available data).
