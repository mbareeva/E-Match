As temperatures have soared and strong winds stoked the flames the past 3 days, killing at least 4 people along with 1,000+ farm animals and sending 60 more people to the hospital as their homes burned down. So far 18 villages have been evacuated and 35 aircrafts, 457 vehicles, and 4,000 personnel have been involved in the firefighting efforts, as separate wildfires raged in the provinces of Osmaniye, Kayseri, Kocaeli, Adana, Mersin and Kutahya. Turkey has battled a series of disasters caused by extreme weather conditions this summer, including flash floods last week that killed 6 people in the Black Sea region so please join us in praying for all the people and animals in these hard hit communities along with the brave firefighters and share this with your followers and friends  Via @karmagawa  #prayforturkey #wildfires #turkey",

Since Ive had a lot of fun sharing our life story in short highlight videos Ive perhaps given the unintended impression that its all been rainbows and kisses, and that marrying your first love is always a romantic and excellent idea. I regularly get messages from young people asking for relationship advice because they want what we have. So here are some of my personal truths and observations. Being right for each other is way more important than how old you are. If we hadnt met at such a young age I would rather have waited for him than commit to the wrong person. True love is worth waiting for. Part of true love is treating each other with the care and respect you both deserve. If you dont believe you deserve those things then take some time to fall in love with yourself first so you give off a vibe that attracts someone who agrees with you. Dont think you can change the wrong person into the right person. People can and do change, but only if they want to for their own reasons, not because someone else sees them as a fixer-upper. If youre going to commit to someone accept their imperfections too youre getting the whole package. Just as there are no perfect people there is no perfect marriage. Everyone struggles at times. Nobody owes anybody the painful parts of their story just know that everybody has them. Continued in comments...",

Too blessed to stress, and God is so good!  I have been working toward this dream with my family for the last 12 years. To my mom and dad, I would not be the Olympian I am today without you. Thank you for sacrificing everything to give me this incredible opportunity to display Gods gifts. To my sister Michaela, youre my best friend and youve seen me at my best and at my worst. I wouldnt be as mentally tough, emotionally secure, and spiritually strong if it wasnt for your love and consistent pouring in to my life.  I also want to thank @tyrsport, @corkcicle, @lyvecap, and @united_re for your support and equipping me to be my best!  Thank you Tokyo, and all of the volunteers for hosting an excellent Olympic Games! We, the athletes and coaches are so grateful.  Lastly, to everybody in my corner. Those of you praying, cheering, and supporting. Thank you for caring and for all of the beautiful messages throughout my career and the Games. I love God, I love my family, I love my country, and I love swimming!  Looking forward to taking some time to surf and celebrate with my friends!

Octopus suckers have something called a chitinous cuticle its kinda like your finger nails, except for octopuses its a protective lining covering the surface of every-single sucker they have!  Just like our fingernails make it easy for us to pick things up, an octopuses textured sucker lining helps them hold onto objects and not let go!  What happens when your nails get too long?  Ya bite em, trim em, or maybe even paint em! When an octopuses sucker lining wears out, it will carefully begin to swirl its 8 arms together until all that's left is hundreds of round translucent sucker discs floating around its den. The outgrown sucker lining sheds off revealing well-manicured squeaky clean suckers! Look at those pearly-whites! And thats not all folks Not only does grooming improve their grip strength, it sharpens their ability to taste and smell with the suckers on their arms! Wild huh?! If you read this far, tell us what ya found most fascinating about this post & if you enjoyed it share to your stories!

Iridophores are found under chromatophores (the cells that give the octopus the ability to change color)  Iridophores are reflector cells responsible for producing the metallic/glow-like greens, blues and golds seen in the Caribbean Reef Octopus, as well as the silver color around its eyes.  With the flora in the reef being so vibrant & diverse, the Caribbean Reef Octopus is able to produce a miraculous amount of color/texture changes!  Watching them forage/hunt is so magical! 1 Theyll parachute and canvas/entrap prey with their arm-web  2 Then blast strong currents of water  to flush out/spook their prey into their suckers.  3 pass the prey item from sucker to sucker like a conveyer belt towards its beak  Whoosh!

With its unearthly glowing colors and silent movements, this gorgeous creature glides through water as if it were weightless. Cuttlefish are masters of the sea with their many superpowers, but one thing that makes them stand out is their unique skirt-like fin. With a muscular fin wrapped around its whole body, the cuttlefish fearlessly moves through water as if they know how skilled they are! (Look at those wise eyes!)  Depending on your angle, the animal appears in any color from shiny greens to blues to match its surroundings- giving them an edge when hiding or hunting prey underwater! When needing to make a quick getaway, cuttlefish morph their tentacles, arms, & body into a sleek looking sports car-like shape and use jet-propulsion to ZOOM backwards at high speeds! The muscular siphon found under their arms is not their mouth but rather its rocket booster they use it to powerfully propel themselves around!  Wonder how they dont bump into anything while jetting backwards at warp speed?Well get thisCuttlefish can squint their W shaped pupils right down the middle and focus on hunting while at the same time watching for predators that might sneak up behind them! Imagine being able to split your pupil into two and being able to see behind yourself!

                "caption": "Ever wonder how mama octos give birth?  : @jmjdiver (strap in and read this)   When a den has been chosen, the mother octopus will often drag rocks to fortify her den to protect against predators.  Shell then turn upside down and cling to the roof of her den to begin the birthing process. Each egg is created in the ovary and then coated with nutrient rich yolk for it to develop in. Sperm is used to fertilize the egg and then the final step is coating the egg with a material that looks like what you can see a translucent rubbery white shell! Mama octos will expel each egg, one by one out of her funnel/siphon, then, using suckers near her beak, painstakingly braid them together into long chains of eggs called festoons. When they reach a certain length (around 175 eggs), Shell produce an adhesive-like secretion at the top of the den to begin another strand or descend to rest & protect her brood    The 30-40 day process involves birthing and braiding 70,000+ eggs and around 400 strands/festoons of eggs.   Mothers meticulously clean and waft currents of water over their eggs so they get a constant supply of fresh, oxygenated water. (Growing eggs require constant influxes of oxygen!)  The hatching off the eggs represents the end of the octopus mothers life as the process of senescence begins. A chemical secretion from her optic gland stops her desire to eat during this process She passes away using the last of her energy to blow the octopus babies into the water column for a better chance of survival!  We love our selfless octopus mothers!  If ya read this far, what did you find most fascinating above? Learn anything? Have anymore questions?  Its wild to me personally that they have this preprogrammed innate ability to begin this process - how do they know how long to make the strands? There is so much more research left to do!  #OctoNation #explore #ocean #expeditions #Octopus #adventure #wildlife #uwphotography #natgeo #natgeoyourshot #nautical #climatechange #cephalopod #planetearth #UnderwaterPhotography #Underwater #myoctopusteacher #education #STEM #homeschool #taxonomy #science",

They spend their whole lives floating in the open sea so having a nearly invisible body comes in super handy  If ya look close, the only things visible are their digestive gland, optic nerves & eyes   Glass octopuses keep their bodies vertical  in the water column or spindle shaped Glass octos figured out that if they keep their bodies horizontal their digestive gland casts more of a shadow to predators! Yeah, no thanks! Theyre too smart for all of that  ... The mating process is super unique with this species  normally a male octopus breaks the tip of his specialized arm filled with packets of sperm (called the hectocotylus) and swims off...  Well the male glass octopus arm doesnt break off!  (sounds dangerous if you consider some species of female octopuses will eat the male) The male will completely envelop the female in his webbing making sure that the sperm is released exactly where it needs to go! (I have a picture of the glass octopuses special arm if youre interested in seeing it  DM us )  Ok so then what?  The female glass octopus broods/matures all the eggs inside of her mantle (body) as she navigates the massive open ocean! They hatch directly from her and the cycle begins all over again.

Turns out they dont give it much thought!  Octopus have a unique specialized musculature thats similar to when clams squeeze & lock their shells to protect themselves.   Rather than exerting energy to keep their clam shell shut, the tension is maintained by smooth muscles that fit like a lock and key until a chemical signal (neurotransmitter) releases them.   Scientists believe that octopus skin can catch the look of the landscape they are on & hold the shape effortlessly without any neural input for up to an hour.

The answer is B, but the word \"carcinologist\" calls to mind the word #carcinogens, or things that cause cancer.  That's because cancer the disease IS named for the crab. Supposedly, Hippocrates (of the Hippocratic oath) called cancers \"karkinos,\" the Greek word for crab, perhaps because of the shape it makes when it grows, with spreading projections from a center. Karkinos was later translated into the Latin word for crab, cancer. So now you know why the #astrological sign Cancer is represented by the crab, and why it has that somewhat off-putting name. Carcinization is the process of things evolving into crab-like forms, which happens enough that it needs a word. Many #animals that look just like crabs are not actually part of the official crab family tree, but they have the same hard shell, long legs, and compact bodies (the hermit crab is one example). This is called convergent #evolution: when a trait is so useful it appears and survives more than once in the plant/animal kingdom, in completely unrelated lineages. Bioluminescence is another example. It has appeared at least nine times independently in the plant and animal kingdom (and that's what we know of). #nature #weird #funfacts #crabs #RIPthecommentsection",

They filter the salt out, but that starts a vicious cycle, since the #saltwater draws the fresh water out through their skin and gills via a process called osmosis. So, they have to drink more. Theoretically, if they weren't constantly ingesting and filtering water, they would dehydrate pretty quickly though. ...Aaaand this only applies to fish living in the #ocean; fish living in freshwater are the exact opposite. Because they are \"saltier\" than the water around them, they automatically absorb a lot of this water and have to pee a lot to avoid holding too much. They don't have to drink through their mouths, though. *Only talking about bony fish; #sharks are different.  #science #education #funfacts #marinebiology #marinebio #saltlife",

How do you tell the difference between a ship and a boat? - The general rule of thumb: you can put a boat on a ship, but you can't put a ship on a boat. - Weighs at least 500 tons - Is capable of crossing the open ocean. For example, large carrier boats on the Great Lakes or paddlewheelers on freshwater rivers, despite being ship-sized, are boats since they never enter the ocean.* - Ships have permanent crew with a commanding officer These are general guidelines--there are still exceptions. Submersibles, even when they're really big, are generally referred to as boats, and even though Commercial fishing vessels can be really big and operate on the high seas, they're still commonly referred to as boats. *Thanks to TikTok commenter Andrew Harrison for the info. : #OceanXplorer by @jpegphotos",

Only the males have that one big claw, and you know what they say about the size of the claw? Thats right: all the better for digging holes, which they live in. The other purpose for the claw is the waving ritual. Basically a male fiddler #crab stands there and waves his big claw around until a female takes notice. (Look at this claw! Look at the amazing burrow I can dig us!) The one problem is that bigger claws are actually less good for fighting. So, crabs with smaller claws might not have as much to work with in the waving ritual, but they can beat up the other crabs and steal their burrows. Which one would you rather be? Also: when a male loses his big claw in a fight, his small claw will grow big to compensate and the missing claw will grow back small. Isnt that weird? That means the big claw is on different sides for fiddler crabs, depending on how scrappy their lives have been. For size reference, the largest fiddler crabs are only about five centimers (two inches) across.

They don't know enough about what conditions were like in the regionwhether, for example, there was an upwelling of cool water mitigating the local water temperature, or whether these #species were more heat tolerant than their descendants.  \"The survival of one group in isolation shouldn't be taken as evidence that changing climates are something to brush off,\" said one of the study's authors, Matt Friedman. The Paleocene-Eocene is widely considered an imperfect but the closest analogy to our current warming climate.** *Likely from volcanos, among other hypotheses. **While there are always people in our comments like \"wEll TEh EaRtH tempArAToor hAS alWayS beEN chAngINg,\" like, no duh, but the difference is that current carbon dioxide emissions are around 10 times the rate that led to the Paleo Eocene Thermal Maximum.

I believe we are blessed because our fore fathers got it right when they wrote in our Declaration of Independence We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. Our fore fathers knew our rights came from God, not man, not a President, not a senator, not a congressman. They knew He was in charge. God has been there for us in all times of struggle and pain in this Nation and has pulled us through. I have no doubt that it is because of the Faithful men and women of America that God has put His hand on this Nation and blessed us beyond measure. America is a beacon of hope all over the globe. People are dying to get into America. The media might tell you differently but people are dying to come here because we are the freest greatest Nation in the World. I hope today you celebrate like never before and always remember the courageous who came before you and paid the ultimate sacrifice for us to be free. Dont hide it, dont shy away from it. Celebrate it, stand up and speak up and share it with everyone. Lets fight for the cause of Freedom. God bless you and your family on this Independence Day!! #july4th #independenceday #usa #America #forefathers #blessedNation #Godisgood",

Also, parents are attending school board meetings and speaking out about this new so called sex education class. My wife and I will be the only ones to teach our kids about the spiritual act of sex, not tv, not movies, not music, no part of culture today, and definitely not a school.

Its not easy to use when the wind is blowing, its a ton of work. Its made for seeing smallmouth on there beds which are usually in 6-12 foot. It works so good on the St Lawrence and Great Lakes bc 1. Water is gin clear 2. Smallmouth are not nearly as spookie , you can literally have your boat over the top of them when bed fishing 3. Cuts glare off water so you can see if the bait is on the bed which is super hard to do if its deep. It was a lot of fun this past week, finished 15th. Thanks Flogger!!",

Animal fact- Crabs interact with each other and are often found in large groups. Marine hermit crabs live in the ocean and land hermit crabs live primarily on land. The hermit crab is not like other crabs. The hermit crabs abdomen does not have a hard covering. To protect the abdomen, a hermit crab inhabits an empty snail shell. The shell also stores water for the crab. Hermit crabs have gills that need to remain moist in order for them to breath. - - - Follow us @amazing.sea.world for more !!  - - Credit : : DM for credit  -  - #shark #sharks #sharkweek #sharktank #sharkattack #sharknado #sharkbait #greatwhiteshark #sharktooth #sharkfishing #sharkie #sharky #savesharks #sharkdiving #sharkteeth #sharklife #sharkbite #sharktattoo #sharkies #sharkeez #tigershark #sharkconservation #whalesharks.",

That is until she realized she was a PHENOMENAL track star, the track coach at Gardner-Webb saw this and offered her a spot on the track team. She decided then to switch from basketball TO RUN TRACK AT A D1 UNIVERSITY!  In college she placed 3rd in the heptathlon and 4x400 at the conference championships. She went on to complete her bachelors in 4 years and did a 5th year to get her masters CHAMP  Without taking a gap year she went straight into Med School at Auburn University. While attending med school she played a lot and I mean a lot of frisbee. She found a semi pro team in her area that held open tryouts. No surprise she made the team. At that point she was in her 3rd year of med school and a semi pro athlete. Fast forward to now and she has graduated!  She is officially a Doctor of Medicine and will be attending her residency at UCLA for Physical Medicine and Rehab. ",

These fish are a member of the angler fish family, deep sea creatures that call the waters 3000ft below the surface of the ocean their home. Only females possess the long stalk on the head, which has a bioluminescent tip used as a lure to entice prey in the darkness of the water, devoid of sunlight.  Their teeth, like pointed shards of glass, are transparent and their large mouth is capable of sucking up and swallowing prey the size of their own body. While females can reach lengths of 24 inches males only grow to be about an inch long and their sole purpose is to find a female and help her reproduce.  Males latch onto the female with their teeth and become sexual parasites, losing their eyes, internal organs, and everything else but the testes. The male becomes a permanent appendage that draws nutrition from its female host and serves as an easily accessible source of sperm.  To see an actual angler fish intact is very rare and it is unknown how or why the fish ended up on the shore. Seeing this strange and fascinating fish is a testament to the diversity of marine life lurking below the waters surface in Californias Marine Protected Areas.

I've been doing price matching for more than a decade -- before there were even apps for it. My mom and I would keep track of the lowest prices and text each other whenever we found something better. Trust me, the BPme app is way easier. Find a bp or Amoco station, fill up and save! @bp_plc   Swipe to look through photos from my trip, and click the link in my bio to download the app!",

I wanted to write few words and acknowledge this wonderful piece of art whose author is unknown (at least to me). When I first saw this picture I was emotional. It brought me back to childhood and my first tennis steps. When I was a kid, I was constructing Wimbledon trophy out of improvised material I could find in my room. I was looking myself in the mirror, saying I am Novak Djokovic, Wimbledon champion. To win this sacred and most special tournament for me for 6th time is surreal. I am blessed and grateful to experience many beautiful moments on the holy grass of Wimbledon. My imagination was very realistic. As every kid, I dreamed,imagined,visualized and believed 100% in my dreams, like they were already achieved. Imagination and visualization is a super power.When children dream and imagine,its the purest form of love and motivation. I was fortunate that I had parents and few more other close people in my career that allowed me to dream and believe I can reach the stars in tennis. I am not saying that everyone will succeed in reaching the biggest heights in tennis. As a parent I believe creating loving and caring environment where we as parents show respect and support for childrens dreams,can do many wonders for our society and sports ecosystem as a whole    ,       .                        .              .               .               .       ,   ,          . /         .                         , ,   .

Any role I can play in helping my boyhood club Im going to do it. Even to my detriment at times. Having been out of the game recovering from the double stress fracture, and having spent a lot of time away from teammates and staff whod been a part of my life for as long as I could remember, I needed to feel a part of something again. I needed to feel like I was playing my part. Ive read some call me selfish for holding off getting the surgery this season but it was never about putting myself first and thats how weve reached this point, and something as a 23 year old Ive had to learn the hard way. To guarantee I can play this game as long as possible I need to listen to my body. Everyone has an opinion but no one knows my body better than me. Its hard to describe the feeling of representing your country. Given the choice no one would ever turn that down at such a big tournament. As a little boy or girl you dream of those moments. I had been deemed fit for the full season, and given my injuries were being managed, what was another couple of weeks? Managing the pain I was training well and found a lot of comfort in the England camp after the Europa League final. On hindsight, if I had of known I wouldnt have played a significant role in the Euros, would I have gone? Hindsight is a wonderful thing isnt it I didnt want to let anyone down but ultimately looking at some of my performances towards the end of last season I felt like I was. When I step on the pitch I always give 100%. Physically my 100% just wasnt possible. Im walking away from last season with 36 goal contributions, but more importantly Im walking away with lessons learnt. We live and we learn as they say but what is never in doubt is my commitment to the club and the national team. Its been a hard one but Im coming back physically and mentally stronger. Thank you for all of the kind messages. ",

Ive had a difficult season, I think thats been clear for everyone to see and I probably went into that final with a lack of confidence. Ive always backed myself for a penalty but something didnt feel quite right. During the long run up I was saving myself a bit of time and unfortunately the result was not what I wanted. I felt as though I had let my teammates down. I felt as if Id let everyone down. A penalty was all Id been asked to contribute for the team. I can score penalties in my sleep so why not that one? Its been playing in my head over and over since I struck the ball and theres probably not a word to quite describe how it feels. Final. 55 years. 1 penalty. History. All I can say is sorry. I wish it had of gone differently. Whilst I continue to say sorry I want to shoutout my teammates. This summer has been one of the best camps Ive experienced and youve all played a role in that. A brotherhood has been built that is unbreakable. Your success is my success. Your failures are mine. Ive grown into a sport where I expect to read things written about myself. Whether it be the colour of my skin, where I grew up, or, most recently, how I decide to spend my time off the pitch. I can take critique of my performance all day long, my penalty was not good enough, it should have gone in but I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from. Ive felt no prouder moment than wearing those three lions on my chest and seeing my family cheer me on in a crowd of 10s of thousands. I dreamt of days like this. The messages Ive received today have been positively overwhelming and seeing the response in Withington had me on the verge of tears. The communities that always wrapped their arms around me continue to hold me up. Im Marcus Rashford, 23 year old, black man from Withington and Wythenshawe, South Manchester. If I have nothing else I have that.  For all the kind messages, thank you. Ill be back stronger. Well be back stronger.  MR10",

All those names and weights on the wall in the back are middle school, high school and college kids, moms and dads, young and old. theyre people who push themselves, put in the work and strive to improve every single day.  It doesnt matter what your goal is, just wake up and work for it everyday. Whatever it is.  #DBWH",
